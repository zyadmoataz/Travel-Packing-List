//There are two types of exports:
//1-Named Export > We will create an export called logo, then we have to import with exactly that name into other file.
//2-Default Export > Usually used in React, We can use any name we want when we import it as its default export.
export default function Logo() {
  return <h1> ğŸŒ´ Far Away ğŸ‘œ</h1>;
}
